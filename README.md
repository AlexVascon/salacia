# ðŸ¥§ Emissions Drill-Down Pie Chart

This project visualizes greenhouse gas emissions data across **three levels** of detail:

1. **Scope** â€” overall emission category (Scope 1, 2, or 3)  
2. **Category** â€” sub-categories within each scope  
3. **Activity** â€” individual emission-producing activities  

Built with **React** and **Highcharts**, this chart lets users click through levels interactively to explore their data.
